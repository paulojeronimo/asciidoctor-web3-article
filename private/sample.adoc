If you write technical texts (like articles, tutorials, ebooks, etc) do you
know that with a single text writing in {AsciiDoc} format (like
{uri-this-doc}[this one]) and <<good-tools,the right tools>>, you could
offer more value to your readers (customers) by presenting it in different
formats? +
{empty} +
Did you know that if you acquire knowledge in {Web3}, you will have much more
creative ways to sell your texts? +
{empty} +
In this article, I will explore a little more about this subject, beginning by
showing you how to generate many outputs from one unique document code
({uri-this-doc}[this]). +
{empty} +
In Part II of this article (coming soon), I will detail how {Web3} technologies
can achieve the second part of the story: help authors sell their texts using
innovative ideas as a plus to the traditional means of payment, which involves
prominent editors.

== Before we start, let me introduce myself

[[FullStackDeveloper]]
I (the <<author,author>> of this article) {uri-pj-fullstackdev}[work as a Full
Stack Developer] who has been acting in several areas of software development
(since 1993). I have experience from the infrastructure to the front end,
passing through {uri-pj-devops}[extensive coding time in middleware and the
back end].

{uri-pj-triathlete}[I'm also a triathlete, three (3) times Ironman].

So I didn't get used to not being an expert in swimming, cycling, or running,
just as I don't consider myself, in my work, an infrastructure, backend, or
frontend expert.

[.underline]#In the software development world, my role has been to put the
pieces of a giant puzzle together#. Today, with the help of technologies of
Artificial Intelligence, my work has been made easier to do.

That way, some of my software tutorials (<<ts,like this one>>)
avoid discussing a single topic. Instead, they combine several things,
providing a more realistic view of how the software works.

As you can read, *[.underline]#I am a {TechWriter}#*. I need to write about
things that I develop or learn, and this is a thing that I like to do. You can
read many of my texts at the following link:

[.text-center]
{uri-pj-sitemap}#articles-or-tutorials.

I'm a Brazilian guy. So English is not my primary language. But I am doing my
best to share my knowledge with you in this language. At the same time, I
intend to help other software developers who speak Portuguese improve their
skills. That's why I also write closed captions in Portuguese for my videos.

:numbered:

<<<
== This is a small article in which I insert a tutorial (a little longer) to explain how you could write it to turn your readers into customers!

[.big.text-center]
As a {TechWriter} +
(and a <<FullStackDeveloper>>),

[.text-center]
[%hardbreaks]
I created <<ts,a tutorial>>
(*<<what-do-we-need,Super easy to follow>>*, as you will see in a moment!{icon-grinning-face})
You don't need to be a programmer like me
to write good professional tutorials and books.
But *<<want-to-know-more,you need to know how to write better>>!*
{empty}
<<ts,This tutorial>> is written in {AsciiDoc} format
(using {uri-asciidoctorjs}[Asciidoctor.js],
one <<my-extension,extension I developed>> for it,
and <<good-tools,other charming tools>>)
[[this-doc]]Here is the source code of it:
ifdef::public-version[]
*{uri-public}/{this-doc}*
({my-extension} generated this code)
endif::[]
ifndef::public-version[]
*{uri-this-doc}*
(this was the original code I wrote)
endif::[]
{empty}
If you want to be a Full Stack Developer
(starting from using {AWS} and {Java}, for example)
you may want to start your journey by following <<ts,this tutorial>>.
But ... wait ... In fact ...
*[red]#this is not a tutorial for newbie programmers#*!
[empty]
[.big.text-center]
*[green]#This is an article that I wrote for {TechWriters}#*!
{empty}
[.text-center]
[%hardbreaks]
So, *the exciting part* of this text
is not about the following <<ts,tutorial>>!
The cool here is the format (<<this-doc,in the {this-doc}>>) presented by
it, not the content.
It's about the way you can write tutorials with the structure and the
<<good-tools,right tools>> to benefit you and your customers.
It's about {uri-public}#benefits[the benefits you can give to your
readers] (when they buy <<ts,this tutorial>>).
****

<<<
[[a-sample-tutorial]] 
== A sample tutorial that you, as a {TechWriter}, could take as an example to write yours (pay attention to its format!)

As mentioned, pay attention to the format I wrote in
({uri-this-doc}[{this-doc}]). At some point, <<my-course,I will launch my
course covering it and other tools>>.

I wrote <<ts,this tutorial>> with an audience studying to take the
{uri-aws-certified-developer}[AWS Certified Developer] certification exam.

Intending to sell texts related to this theme, my strategy to sell them is,
among others, to present the execution of the private version of my tutorial in
a video on my YouTube channel. But, in the video description, I offer a link to
the public text of my tutorial and show the benefits readers will get when they
buy it.

So, in short, to sell my tutorials, my strategy needs:

. {uri-public}#ts[A public version of my tutorial].
.. This link above is copied to the video description where I it.
.. It includes a section where I present my
{uri-public}#about-this-tutorial[benefits to buyers].
. {uri-private}#ts[A private version of it], including
ifdef::backend-html5[]
{uri-private}#pdf-version[this PDF].
endif::[]
ifdef::backend-pdf[]
this PDF you are reading.
endif::[]
.. It includes a section where <<about-this-tutorial,I thank my customers>>
and give them all their benefits.

In practical terms, you will not like creating an AWS environment using what I
will present in this tutorial. To create a cloud infrastructure on AWS,
solutions like {uri-aws-cdk}[AWS CDK], {uri-terraform}[Terraform], or even
{uri-vagrant}[Vagrant] ({uri-github-pj-gs-rest-service-aws}[the way I
showed in this Git repository (which I built in 2018)]) are much more practical
and straightforward.

I also use many other alternatives (cheaper and very fast to mount) to create
development environments. For example, {uri-aws-cloud9}[AWS Cloud9],
{uri-github-codespace}[GitHub Codespace], {uri-gitpod}[Gitpod], etc.

However, the basic knowledge (of {AWS} and {Java} fundamentals) I will give you
in this tutorial is quite valuable for learning purposes. For example, suppose
you want to obtain the {uri-aws-certified-developer}[AWS Certified Developer]
certification. What you will practice using the commands below will serve as a
basis for understanding {uri-aws-iam}[IAM] and {uri-aws-ec2}[EC2], which, in
turn, are required in the test for this certification.

So, in the <<part-1,first part>>, I demonstrate how to create a machine to
develop applitions using {Java} and {NodeJS}. In <<part-2,part 2>>, I
illustrate the use of this environment to construct charming applications
in my following tutorials.

WARNING: In this tutorial my focus is not teatch you how to develop in {Java}
or {NodeJS}. So, here I'll show you only a simple "Hello World!" in both
languages.

<<part-3,Finally>>, I present how you can unbuild
the cloud environment.

[[what-do-we-need]]
==== What do we need to install to follow this tutorial?

*[.underline]#Nothing but a browser!#*

We'll only need to have access to our root AWS account. So, if you don't have
an account on AWS, create it.

After that, we'll be using {AWSCloudShell} to {copy-n-paste} all the commands
(Bash scripts) in this tutorial to it. These scripts extensively use {AWSCLI}
commands (commented on them).

==== What do we need to know before starting it?

Only two programming languages, at a basic level of knowledge:

* Shell Scripting ({Bash}).
* {Java}. We'll use the {GraalVM}.
* {JavaScript} (with {NodeJS} inside {GraalVM}).

We'll build a Linux development environment. So, I assume you know the basics
about it too.

[[part-1]]
==== -> Part 1 <-

*All the commands that I will show you here need only to be typed (or copied)
to a terminal running Bash ({AWSCloudShell}).* So, just open it and start to
{copy-n-paste} the following commands. Simple as that!{icon-winking-face}

You can right-click on each code block in image format using this PDF to open
it in your browser. Then you can use the famous "{copy-n-paste}".

===== Creating an AWS user

[,bash,gen-code:bash/create-aws-user.sh]
----
{
  echo Creating the User
  aws iam create-user --user-name FullStackDev

  echo Creating an Access Key
  access_key=$(aws iam create-access-key --user-name FullStackDev)

  echo Saving the access key
  echo "$access_key" > FullStackDev.access-key.json

  echo Attaching the required policies to the user
  for policy in AmazonEC2FullAccess AWSCloudShellFullAccess
  do
    aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name FullStackDev \
      --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/$policy
  done

  echo -n Retrieving the Account ID '(12 digits): '
  aws sts get-caller-identity --query 'Account' \
    --output text > FullStackDev.accountid.txt
  cat FullStackDev.accountid.txt

  echo Creating a password for the user FullStackDev

  # See the NOTE password-generation
  echo "1^$(tr -cd '[:alnum:]' < /dev/urandom |
    fold -w11 | head -n1)" > FullStackDev.password.txt

  # After the command below, you can test your login
  # (NOTE login-testing)
  echo Creating a login profile for user FullStackDev
  aws iam create-login-profile --user-name FullStackDev \
    --password $(<FullStackDev.password.txt)
}
----

ifndef::public-version[]
Some NOTES about the code above:

* *password-generation* -> The password is randomly generated. It starts with 
the fixed `1^`. Then it gains 11 more characters. This is to avoid the
following error:
+
----
An error occurred (PasswordPolicyViolation) when calling the CreateLoginProfile
operation: Password should meet 1 more of the following requirements: Password
should have at least one number, Password should have at least one symbol
----
* *login-testing*: Use the output of the next command in order to
login on AWS through a new incognito browser window:
+
[,bash,gen-code:bash/new-aws-login.sh]
----
cat <<EOF
Open https://$(<FullStackDev.accountid.txt).signin.aws.amazon.com/console

-> Credentials <-
IAM User name: FullStackDev
Password: $(<FullStackDev.password.txt)

-> References ->
AWS/sign-in-urls-defined
EOF
----
+
After logging, access the {AWSCloudShell} and try this command:
+
[,bash,gen-code:bash/iam-get-user.sh]
----
aws iam get-user --query 'User.UserName' --output text
----
+
You will receive the following error:
+
----
An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the GetUser operation: User:
arn:aws:iam::229248205759:user/FullStackDev is not authorized to perform:
iam:GetUser on resource: user FullStackDev because no identity-based policy
allows the iam:GetUser action
----
+
So, back back to the cloudshell opened with your root account, type the 
following command to give that permission to the user `FullStackDev`:
+
[,bash,gen-code:bash/iam-attach-user-policy.sh]
----
aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name FullStackDev \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMReadOnlyAccess
----
+
Now, test the last `FullStackDev` command. You will see that it will succeed! +
Sign out `FullStackDev` and close its incognito window.
endif::[]

===== Defining some AWS environment variables

The variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are used
to indicate that we will be using the user `FullStackDev` in our following
{AWSCLI} commands.

[,bash,gen-code:bash/create-aws-envvars.sh]
----
{
  echo Defining some environment variables
  export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(jq -r '.AccessKey.AccessKeyId' \
    ~/FullStackDev.access-key.json)
  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(jq -r '.AccessKey.SecretAccessKey' \
    ~/FullStackDev.access-key.json)
  export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
}
----

Instead of using these environment variables, we could also use the command `aws
configure` to set them in a directory called `~/.aws/`.
This command will create files named `credentials` and `config` inside this
directory with the same information configured in the variables above.

[NOTE]
====
. We are using these variables in the cloud shell we are using for the root
user because we want all objects created from the following commands to be
associated with the FullStackDev user and not with our root user. That's good
practice!
. We wouldn't need to define these environment variables if we kept the
CloudShell window used by the FullStackDev user open and executed the instance
creation commands inside it.
====

===== Creating the AWS instance

Let's configure some other environment variables related to the machine we'll
create and export them:

[,bash,subs=attributes+,gen-code:bash/create-my_machine-variables.sh]
----
{
  export my_machine_name={my_machine_name}
  export my_machine_security_group=DevMachines
}
----

Create the instance:

[,bash,gen-code:bash/create-aws-instance.sh]
----
{
  echo Creating the Security Group \"$my_machine_security_group\"
  aws ec2 create-security-group \
    --group-name $my_machine_security_group --description $my_machine_name

  echo Authorizing access to port 22
  aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
    --group-name $my_machine_security_group --protocol tcp --port 22 \
    --cidr 0.0.0.0/0

  echo Creating the Key Pair
  aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name FullStackDev \
    --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > FullStackDev.pem
  chmod 400 FullStackDev.pem

  echo Building a backup of all credentials. \
    Save it to your computer!
  tar cvf FullStackDev.tar FullStackDev.*

  echo Launching the EC2 Instance
  aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-053b0d53c279acc90 \
    --count 1 --instance-type t2.medium --key-name FullStackDev \
    --security-group-ids $my_machine_security_group --tag-specifications \
    "ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=$my_machine_name}]"
}
----

Wait for the instance creation:

[,bash,gen-code:bash/wait-instance-creation.sh]
----
{
  echo Waiting for \"$my_machine_name\" to Start ...
  aws ec2 wait instance-running --filters \
    "Name=tag:Name,Values=$my_machine_name"

  echo -n 'Retrieving the Instance ID: '
  instance_id=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --filters \
    "Name=tag:Name,Values=$my_machine_name" --query \
    'Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId' --output text)
  echo $instance_id

  echo -n 'Retrieving the Public DNS Name: '
  public_dns_name=$(aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --instance-ids $instance_id --query \
    'Reservations[].Instances[].PublicDnsName' --output text)
  echo $public_dns_name

  echo "ubuntu@$public_dns_name" > FullStackDev.$my_machine_name
  tar rf FullStackDev.tar FullStackDev.$my_machine_name
}
----

===== Saving the user credentials

Not that you you will have a bunch of 
`FullStackDev` files generated:

[,bash,gen-code:bash/ls-FullStackDev.sh]
----
ls -la FullStackDev.*
----

[,txt,gen-code:txt/ls-FullStackDev.txt]
----
include::{includes-dir}/{docname}/ls-FullStackDev.txt[]
----

We may want to save the file `FullStackDev.tar`
if we want keep our virtual machine.

In order to download this file, click in `Actions/Download file`,
as shown in the following figure:

image::cloudshell.1.png[]

Next, specify the name of the file to download:

image::cloudshell.2.png[]

===== Logging into the instance via SSH

[,bash,gen-code:bash/logging-into-the-instance.sh]
----
{
  echo Entering the Instance via SSH
  ssh -i FullStackDev.pem ubuntu@$public_dns_name
}
----

[TIP]
====
If you saved the `FullStackDev.tar` file on a local machine with a Linux
environment in a directory called `~/Downloads`, you could try the following
steps to gain remote access to the `{my_machine_name}` machine we just created:

[,bash,gen-code:bash/logging-into-the-devmachine1.sh]
----
{
  cd ~/Downloads
  tar xf FullStackDev.tar
  ssh -i FullStackDev.pem $(<FullStackDev.$my_machine_name)
}
----
====

===== Checking the software versions

After following the last section, you should have your Linux machine created.
It will be an environment mounted with a Ubuntu version 22.04.

So, the following are the only prerequisites that we need to attend before
<<starting-to-code,starting to code in Java>>:

. An {Bash} terminal.
. <<add-packages,Zip and Unzip installed>> (to <<sdkman,install SDKMAN>>).
. Git installed and <<git-configure,configured>>.
. <<java-install,Java installed>>.

These are the expected versions of the software prerequisites, after the
machine creation:

|===
| Command | Expected Ouput

a|
[,bash,gen-code:bash/bash-version.sh]
----
echo $BASH_VERSION
----
a|
[,txt,gen-code:txt/bash-version.txt]
----
5.1.16(1)-release
----

a|
[,bash,gen-code:bash/git-version.sh]
----
git --version
----
a|
[,txt,gen-code:txt/git-version.txt]
----
git version 2.34.1
----
|===

ifdef::public-version[]

{ThisIsAFeatureForCustomers}
endif::[]

[[add-packages]]
===== Installing more packages

Install some other required packages:

[,bash,gen-code:bash/install-packages.sh]
----
{
  sudo apt update

  # required by SDKMAN:
  sudo apt -y install zip unzip

  # required by GraalVM native-image:
  sudo apt -y install gcc zlib1g-dev
}
----

[TIP]
====
*In a Ubuntu 22.04 local machine environment* (your actual machine, outside the
AWS), you could do our next steps by creating a local user `dev` and setting a
password for it:

[,bash,gen-code:bash/useradd.sh]
----
{
  sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G sudo dev
  sudo passwd dev
}
----

After that, you could use `sudo` to logging in with:

[,bash,gen-code:bash/login-as-dev.sh]
----
sudo su - dev
----
====

[[git-configure]]
===== Configuring Git

[,bash,gen-code:bash/configure-git.sh]
----
{
  confirm() {
    local prompt=$1
    local varname=$2
    while :
    do
      read -p "$prompt: " myvar
      read -p "Confirm (Y/n)? " -n 1 -r
      echo
      [[ ${REPLY:-y} =~ ^[Yy]$ ]] && {
        eval $varname="'$myvar'"
        break
      }
    done
  }
  confirm user.name my_user &&
    git config --global user.name "$my_user"
  confirm user.email my_user &&
    git config --global user.email "$my_user"
  git config --global init.defaultBranch main
}
----

Verify your configurations:

[,bash,gen-code:bash/verify-git.sh]
----
git config --global --list
----

[[sdkman]]
===== Installing SDKMAN

[,bash,gen-code:bash/install-sdkman.sh]
----
{
  curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
  source ~/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh
}
----

[[java-install]]
===== Installing Java (GraalVM version)

[,bash,gen-code:bash/install-java.sh]
----
sdk install java 22.3.r19-grl && java -version
----

===== Installing Node.js (with GraalVM)

Install the Node.js component, check the location of `node` and `npm` commands and their versions:

[,bash,gen-code:bash/gu-install-nodejs.sh]
----
{
  gu install nodejs
  echo
  for cmd in node npm
  do
    echo -n "$cmd (location / version): "
    which $cmd | tr -d '\n'
    echo -n " / "; $cmd -v
  done
}

==== -> Part 2 <-

[[starting-to-code]]
===== Building the classic "Hello World!" in Java

We will create a simple Java code that prints a "Hello World!".

To do this using our opened terminal, {copy-n-paste} the following commands to
it:

ifdef::show-hidden-block[]
[,java,gen-code-java:java/HelloWorld.java]
----
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
----
endif::[]

[,bash,subs=attributes+,gen-code:bash/create-java-code.sh]
----
{
  mkdir -p simple-tutorial/{gen-code-java-dir} && cd $_
  cat <<'EOF' > {gen-code-java-file}
include::{generated-src-dir}/{gen-code-java}[]
EOF
}
----

Compile and run the code:

[,bash,subs=attributes+,gen-code:bash/build-and-run-java-code.sh]
----
javac {gen-code-java-file} && java HelloWorld
----

Install GraalVM `native-image`:

[,bash,gen-code:bash/gu-install-native-image.sh]
----
gu install native-image
----

Build ant test the `helloworld` binary:

[,bash,gen-code:bash/native-image-helloworld.sh]
----
native-image HelloWorld
----

This takes a minute to execute:

//[,bash,gen-code:txt/native-image-HelloWorld.txt]
//....
//include::{includes-dir}/{docname}/native-image-HelloWorld.txt[]
//....
image::helloworld.png[]

Test the `helloworld`:

[,bash,gen-code:bash/helloworld.sh]
----
./helloworld
----

In terms of performance, a native image is much superior:

[,bash,gen-code:txt/native-helloworld.txt]
----
$ time java HelloWorld 
Hello World!

real    0m0.076s
user    0m0.085s
sys     0m0.014s

$ time ./helloworld 
Hello World!

real    0m0.003s
user    0m0.003s
sys     0m0.000
----

Check the `helloworld` binary dependencies:

[,bash,gen-code:bash/ldd-helloworld.sh]
----
ldd helloworld
----

This is what we expect to see as a result:

[,txt,gen-code:txt/ldd-helloworld.txt]
----
linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffea9353000)
libz.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so.1 (0x00007f2438e40000)
libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f2437e00000)
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f2438e77000)
----

Initialize a new Git repository and make your first commit:

[,bash,gen-code:bash/git-init-and-commit.sh]
----
{
  cd ..
  git init
  cat > .gitignore <<EOF
*.class
/java/helloworld*
EOF
  git add .
  git commit -m 'Made my first commit. Added HelloWorld.java'
}
----

===== Building the classic "Hello World!" in JavaScript

[,bash,gen-code:bash/create-helloworld-js.sh]
----
{
  mkdir javascript && cd $_
  cat > HelloWorld.js <<'EOF'
console.log('Hello World!')
EOF
  node HelloWorld.js
}
----

Let's do all last `git commit` in this tutorial:

[,bash,gen-code:bash/git-commit-helloworld-js.sh]
----
git add -A && git commit -m 'Added HelloWorld.js'

== Want to know more about how to write texts (tutorials, ebooks) like this one?

[[good-tools]]
=== I can indicate some good tools to you

Here are some of the tools that I have experience in use to create my texts:

[cols="1,4"]

. {Markdown} and {GFM}
. {MDX}
. {AsciiDoc}

| Text processors
a|
. {Txt2tags}
. {_Asciidoctor} ({Ruby} version) including:
.. {AsciidoctorJS} ({JavaScript} version) including {uri-asciidoctor-extensions}[many extensions] like {my-extension}
.. {AsciidoctorJ} ({Java} version)

| Text Editor

. {Java}
. {Groovy}

|===

[[my-extension]]
==== My *gen-code* extension

. Is a {AsciidoctorJS} {uri-preprocessor-extension}[Preprocessor Extension].
. The source of this document ({uri-this-doc}[{this-doc}]) uses it which is responsible for:
.. Generate source files from source code that are inside some source blocks.
.. Generate attributes used by the document itself.
.. Convert these generated codes to images using tools like {uri-silicon}[Silicon] and {uri-text2png}[Text2png].
.. Generate another document {uri-public}/{this-doc}[{this-doc} (public)] that only refer to the images created.
. Currently, its source code is unavailable, but it will soon be open source.

=== I can offer you a consultancy ...

\... in which I will give you my tips about <<good-tools,the tools I use to
create my documents>> and/ or we'll create some documents together on a topic
of your need.

[[my-course]]
=== You can buy `my docs-as-code course` (it will be available soon)

[[course-docs]]
In my course, we will explore how the {AsciiDoc} format is used in some of my
`docs-as-code` projects, including these:

. The project that builds this document you are reading.
.. It is created with some code in {Bash} and {JavaScript} (running on {NodeJS}).
.. It uses {my-extension}.
.. Currently, the generated PDF version is created by
{uri-asciidoctor-pdf}[asciidoctor-pdf] (which uses a Ruby execution
environment). But, until the availability of this course, I intend to migrate it
to use {AsciidoctorWebPDF}.
. https://github.com/paulojeronimo/paulojeronimo.github.io[The project of my WebSite].
. https://paulojeronimo.com/cv/README.html[The project of my CV].
. Some AsciiDoc slides, like these:
.. https://paulojeronimo.com/asciidoc-dzslides-slides/

So, based on the code of the projects above, we will see how the following
tools are used to build AsciiDoc documents:

. {Neovim} <- My favorite text editor.
. {Bash} <- We'll use how I use it to build <<course-docs,these docs>>.
.. {docker-asciidoctor-builder} <- A simple {Bash} tool that I developed and use a lot
. {_Asciidoctor} ({Ruby} version).
. {AsciidoctorJS} and some extensions (including {my-extension}).
. https://pages.github.com/[GitHub Pages].

As a bonus, I also intend to show you a little about the following tools:

. {AsciidoctorWebPDF}.
. https://antora.org/[Antora].
